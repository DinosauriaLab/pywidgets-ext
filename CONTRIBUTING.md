## Providing Examples

It's crucial to include example content (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) in each widget. This allows users to directly execute `python -m pywidgets_ext.<widget>` to understand the purpose of each widget and how to use it effectively. By providing clear and concise examples, you contribute to a smoother user experience and encourage the adoption of the widgets.
